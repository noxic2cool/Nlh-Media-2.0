      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <p>Hey there, I’m Shaffick Ali. I run a YouTube channel called NLH Media. The reason I started it was because of a project in school I had to do at William Paterson University, where I would run an Instagram page where I would talk about highlights about different basketball players throughout time. I did this as I have a major interest in sport and dream to work for ESPN one day.</p>
          <br>
      <p class="p2">I started my YouTube channel mainly reporting on news in regards to sports, music and entertainment, along with some gameplay of a game I like to play, but later incorporated rapping into it, as it’s something that I’ve always loved and wanted to do.</p>
          <br>
      <p class="p2">I named my channel NLH Media as the NLH stands for “Never Lose Hope.” It’s a motto that has helped me get through the darkest fo times in my life, but also one I use as I want to inspire people to keep pushing through any dark times in their lives to the light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you for your support, and as always, never lose hope!</p>
