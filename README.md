Shaffick Ali's/NLH Media's Official Website (2.0) by Blade Kirksey

Hey there, this is actually a remaking of the previous "Website for a Friend" website. 

Those website originally were pure HTML and CSS, but this time  I used JS and PHP, which helped to add more functionality for the website. 

I also decided to overhaul the look and feel of the website to something more professional, while adding subtile hints of personal meaning to my friend (the blue and orange are the Knicks' color ways, whilst background is from New Jersey, wehre he's from.)
